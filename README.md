# BRFSS-EDA-2020 

### Data availability
Exploratory data analysis of CDC [2020 BRFSS Survey Data](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2020.html).  
Dataset converted from ASCII to csv format found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aemreusta/brfss-2020-survey-data). 

### Purpose  
The aim of this analysis is to compare different models' accuracy when predicting a stroke based on key health factors. 

This analysis is an adaptation of an analysis by user JOngH on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jongheonjeong/diabetes-eda-featureselection-conclusion). This analysis was performed on the 2015 BRFSS Survey Data and was focused on diabetes prediction. I decided to perform a similar analysis to see how well newer data would perform for stroke prediction.
